# Write-ups
This is where I collect and show off write-ups of many different challenges, projects and CTFs I've completed. 
Topics may vary a lot; like hacking, reverse engineering, malware analysis and hardware projects. Write-ups with similar topics will be in the same folder.

I make and publish these write-ups mostly in order to (1) reinforce my own learning process and (2) create a real track record of my knowledge and experience for future employers.
Definitely feel free to use these for your own learning process however you like. Just bear in mind that I did not write these in a _tutorial_ type of style, and prior knowledge up to a certain point might be needed.
